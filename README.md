Hangperson: a scaffolded (!) ESaaS getting-started assignment
=============================================================

Assignment 2 of Berkeley's [CS169](https://www.edx.org/course/agile-development-using-ruby-rails-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x)
course on edX: Agile Development Using Ruby on Rails (Basics)   

A lot of the tests came directly from the [assignment repository](https://github.com/saasbook/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson).
All credit goes there.    

My primary goals were to:
* Create and deploy a simple SaaS application
* Practice the basic workflow of test-driven development (TDD), in which tests are written before the code (so they fail when first run) and code is then added to make them pass
* Familiarize myself with using RSpec and Cucumber
* Learn to think about how to design the application's actions in a _RESTful_ way

The final application here is just a simple Hangman game, which you can play [here](https://fierce-bayou-87464.herokuapp.com/new).
